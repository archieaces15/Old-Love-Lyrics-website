    When you were here, the stars disappear
   <br> Nothing can outshine the dress that you wear
   <br>We should be dancing 'cause girl you look stunning
   <br>Let's spend the night together 'til reach the morning
   <br>Up and above, never enough
   <br>I wanna hold your hand and show what is love
   <br>When you are smiling and when you are laughing
   <br> We should keep dancing to treasure the feelings
   <br>Like it's the old love (it's the old love)
   <br>This is the way that we both wanna feel
   <br>Under the moonlight we made our first kiss
   <br>'Cause this is the moment that you made me feel
   <br> Like it's the old love (it's the old love)
   <br> Come on and hold me, I want you right here
   <br>Stay close to me, so you don't feel the fear
   <br>I'll never let go 'cause I'm just right here
   <br>When I'm with you, it's like déjà vu
   <br>I realize that dreams really come true
   <br> We keep on talking for the moment we live in
   <br> Let's keep drinking 'til the moon disappear
   <br> You are the one, the one that I want
   <br> The one that will stay by my side 'til I'm gone
   <br>The love of my life and I'll sacrifice
   <br>Just for the moment we last long forever
   <br>Like it's the old love (it's the old love)
   <br>This is the way that we both wanna feel
   <br>Under the moonlight we made our first kiss
   <br>'Cause this is the moment that you made me feel
   <br>Like it's the old love
   <br>Come on and hold me, I want you right here
   <br>Stay close to me, so you don't feel the fear
   <br>I'll never let go 'cause I'm just right here
   <br>Like it's the old love
   <br>It's the old love
   <br>This is the way that we both wanna feel
   <br>Under the moonlight we made our first kiss
   <br>'Cause this is the moment that you made me feel
   <br>Like it's the old love
